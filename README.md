## About Me

Hey there! I’m Tasha, also known as WolfQuery. A student and hobby programmer who loves exploring the world of code. Most of my projects revolve around game development using **Godot 4**, but I also enjoy tinkering with **Python CLIs** and writing **bash scripts** to automate my workflow.

I’m passionate about Linux and use a **riced Arch Linux setup with i3** as my daily driver—customized for both efficiency and style.

> **Personal Motto:** “C’est la vie.”
